Twitter Sentiment Analysis: A Comparative Study Between Convolutional-Bidirectional LSTM and GRU Networks

## Abstract

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a subfield within natural language processing (NLP) that focuses on extracting and categorizing subjective information from unstructured text. This project aims to analyze the sentiment expressed in mental health-related tweets on Twitter using advanced deep learning models such as Convolutional Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvBiLSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).
The ConvBiLSTM model combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for local feature extraction with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks for capturing sequential dependencies. The GRU model, known for its efficiency in sequence modeling, is also employed to handle long-range dependencies in Twitter text. 
Our comparative study demonstrates that the ConvBiLSTM model achieves higher accuracy (93.24%) compared to the GRU model in sentiment analysis of Twitter data. This indicates that the ConvBiLSTM model is more effective in detecting subtle variations in sentiment expression on Twitter.
